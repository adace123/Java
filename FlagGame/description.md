* A JavaFX/FXML game that works as follows:
    1. Once the start button is clicked, a panel appears with a country name at the top and six flag images below, one of which corresponds to that name.
    2. The player has both a time limit (which resets after each correct guess) and 3 hearts ("lives") which go down by 1 after an incorrect guess.
    3. Once the player is out of lives or out of time, he/she is prompted to enter his/her name.
    4. The username and score is then saved to file and displayed by clicking the "High Scores" button on the start screen.
* Created as part of group project. I helped work on the FXMLDocumentController class to implement the game logic as well as on the layout using Gluon Scene Builder.
