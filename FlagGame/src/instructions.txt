Welcome to GeoFlag!

The objective of the game is to guess the flag that corresponds to the country name displayed in the upper box.
If you guess incorrectly, you lose one life out of three.
If run out of hearts or the timer reaches 0, it's game over.
Each time you guess correctly, you gain a point and your life as well as your time limit is replenished.

After the game is over, you will be prompted to enter your name and your score will be saved.
All the scores can be viewed at any time by clicking the "High Scores" button on the start screen.

Hope you enjoy & good luck!
